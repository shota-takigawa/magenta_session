# Session with your own model

I think you want to session with your own Musical Model! 
If so, set the `MAGENTA_MODEL` environmental variable.

```
export MAGENTA_MODEL=my_model
```

Then startup **magenta session server**!

```
python server/server.py
```

You can play the Call & Response with your model!
